# Universal Solar
This is the repository for Universal Solar, an application made for the CBUS Student Hack.
This application aims to bring solar to a wider audience by increasing affordability and
lowering the entry price. It also brings an innovative new feature - using Autodesk Forge,
the app can build a 3D model of the user's house for estimates. Currently, this is not 
hooked up to any contractors, and is for demo purposes only.

## Installing
Git clone the repository, then run `npm install`. Then, run `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`.

## Building
To build a binary, ensure you have cloned the repository and installed packages. Then, run `react-native build`.

## Tests
What are those?! Just kidding. This application was made in a bit of a time crunch (frankly it's a miracle
that it was done on time), and as a result I didn't worry about tests or flow. I hope to add that in the future though.
